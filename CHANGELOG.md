### 0.1.0

This release marks the first iteration of the AudioSwitch library: an Android audio management library for real-time communication apps.

This initial release comes with the following features:

-  Manage [audio focus](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media-apps/audio-focus) for typical VoIP and Video conferencing use cases.
-  Manage audio input and output devices.
    -  Detect changes in available audio devices
    -  Enumerate audio devices
    -  Select an audio device

We intend to iterate on these initial set of features and look forward to collaborating with the community.
